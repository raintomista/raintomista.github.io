In this study, a mobile application was developed for exploring the potential of deep learning in software development. It transforms hand-drawn wireframes into an interactive and fully-functional prototype with the use of deep learning. The study also provided a wireframing convention which works best with the trained model. With a usability score of 80.94%, the developed mobile application has proven to be excellent in usability. Nearly 97.2% of the respondents believed that it will be helpful in prototyping mobile applications.
