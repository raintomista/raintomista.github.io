AppVenture Time is an employee management and time-logging system made exclusively for the use of AppVenture, Inc. It features a real-time employee monitor and an email notification system for administrators to determine who among the employees came in late or did not show up. It also prevents unauthorized time-logging with the IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting feature.
